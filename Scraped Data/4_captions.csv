4_captions,Young Sheldon Season 2 Compilation 1 #bestofsheldon,hello hi who are you i'm paige i like your bow tie thank you you seem awfully young paige are you with an adult who's taking this class no dr sturridge has heard about my research on quantum chromodynamics at high temperatures and invited me to audit his course is that so yes he's been super nice interesting well just so we're clear he's my mentor he's my me mom's boyfriend and he had spaghetti and hot dogs at my house this spaghetti goes on hot dogs no you realize this is a very advanced class we'll be discussing deriving nuclear physics from the quark model do you know if you'll be doing a full color optic calculation with matrix manipulations are you not do you know how to differentiate under the integral sign no oh do you know anything i know you're in my spot how old are you i'm tim i'm 10 2. when's your birthday february 26th march 17th and i'm the youngest person in this class that's funny oh good i see you two have met i'm younger than him how come you never mentioned she was coming to this class i thought it would be a fun surprise i don't like surprises neither do i then why did you do it some people like surprises i love surprises did you enjoy this one yes a 50 success rate not bad anyone know what happens to quarks when we combine them to make maisons and baryons yes paige we can ignore the particle masses at the individual quark level correct you are really he's jealous of you paying attention to her that was correct paige and sheldon is that a new bow tie it is looking sharp thanks dr mccoy was an idiot now since we'll be spending a few hours together i've created a list of activities to keep us occupied we'll start with the tour by room then board games and if time permits you can look at and not touch my trains my little pony i love my little pony that's my sister's and it's not part of the tour i share a room with my sister too super fun you're wrong now over here we have my desk this is my computer that's my mouse this is my printer this is the paper that goes in the printer this is a box of extra paper that also goes in the printer and this is my signed picture of professor proton do you watch a show no i don't really like it you don't i think he's boring mandy dumbs everything down come on colinar don't fail me now and next on the tour we have a lamp we could play traditional chess or if you're interested we could play a variant with the new piece i invented that sounds fun it's a new piece a wizard the wizard cannot be taken and at any point he can teleport and switch places with any other piece yes but there's an obvious flaw what flaw well anytime anyone is checkmated they can simply have the wizard and their king switch places so the game will never end i knew that you passed my test you actually believe the multiverse theory very much so it's the most elegant interpretation of quantum mechanics so you really think there are an infinite number of universes stephen hawking believes it so yes i do well if there are an infinite number of universes i think that theory is dumb in all of them this is fun i don't get to have discussions like this with kids at my school do you no do you ever wish you were just like everyone else not at all me neither i love being smarter than everyone too i started to think that paige and i might have more in common than i thought maybe my mother was right i really did just need to get to know her better checkmate you lose [Music] i don't know if ten-year-old spock ever flipped a chess board but ten-year-old sheldon sure did [Music]
