To everyone their own tastes I guess, but just in this clip I wanted to punch him to the next dimension quite a few times. There are reasons why such kids never go far in real life by keeping that attitude: NO ONE likes it, because no one likes narcissists. And once adult? This attitude, if you managed to keep it with everyone around you hating it, will have severe consequences straight away in your early life.
This isn't being smart or just arrogant. When you need to bring everyone down around you to remind them, harshly, and force it down their throats that you're the smartest: It's narcissism. No wonder this show has so much success...
Might look wholesome, but it's just narcissism, sorry guys.
Same reason I never found the adult Sheldon funny: Yeah, comedy, sitcom, funny, but when you understand he's just a pathological narcissist... yeah, makes it a whole lot less funny doesn't it?
Anyway, that was just my opinion. Peace.",0,0,2022-01-28T11:08:58Z,Sarcasm
